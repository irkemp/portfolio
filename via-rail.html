                            VIA Rail has two big problems it can't control. Their passenger trains
                            have to give the right of way to freight trains, and the cellular network
                            their onboard Wi-Fi system connects to is limited.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The math isn't difficult:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            Delays + Unreliable Wi-Fi = Unhappy Customers
                        </code>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            I started by intervewing passengers in stations and on trains, both as an official
                            representative of VIA and undercover. We learned that passengers were frustrated
                            by the delays and Wi-Fi, but they were angry about not knowing why and for how long.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a passenger, these questions often generate anxiety:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where am I currently?</li>
                            <li>When will I get to my destination?</li>
                            <li>Does the Wi-Fi work at all?</li>
                            <li>Will my call get dropped?</li>
                            <li>Why isn't my Instagram loading?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The other problem the business faced? VIA Rail needed a solution that didn't cost $200,000.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mb-5">
                        <div style="font-size: 1.2rem;" class="mb-3">How do you <span class="green-text bold-text">create control</span> that doesn't exist?</div>
                        <p>
                            VIA Rail had already developed a simple HTML webpage that used real-time train data to
                            display a given train's schedule and location. Unusually, the tool
                            wasn't advertised to passengers at all and was considered one of VIA's "best kept secrets".
                        </p>
                        <figure class="figure">
                            <img src="images/via-interface-before.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="...">
                            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">The schedule table and map component of the original application</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            The application was an excellent foundation, but it had the potential to improve. The map looks nice,
                            but it feels like I'm floating in the void. Where are the stations? Where did I start? Where am I going?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I prototyped the new app, I frequently rode the train to get passenger opinions, allowing for
                            uniquely continuous design validation. This was the result:
                        </p>
                        <figure class="figure">
                            <img src="images/via-interface-after.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="...">
                            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">The prototype shows the train route, stations and Wi-Fi status in real-time</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            The enhancement required aggregating millions of raw Wi-Fi diagnostic data points into GeoJSON fragments.
                             Using Python, the GeoJSON data could then be intelligently divided into segments based on average expected Wi-Fi speed.
                             With improved location context using the map, and information about the current Wi-Fi status, the application was ready
                             to become the new official Wi-Fi landing page.
                        </p>
